This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

To run this project properly you will need to get<br>
a few API keys. The client ID and Secret from Spotify<br>
and an Open Weather Map Key. please these API keys as<br>
the following environment variables in your .env<br>
file.

```
SPOTIFY_ID
SPOTIFY_SECRET
OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY
```
You can get your Spotify keys from https://developer.spotify.com/

You can get your Open Weather Map API Key from https://openweathermap.org/

In the project directory, you can run:

```sh
    `yarn install`
```

Adds all required packages for client side and back end.

```
    `yarn start`
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
This command will open the app in your default browser.<br>
If you want to avoid this behavior run the following command:<br>

### `UBROWSER=none yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Testing

### `yarn test`

Tests to come.<br>
